#The rate in Hz at which to run the control loop and send velocity commands to the base.
controller_frequency: 10.0

#How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a valid control before space-clearing operations are performed.
controller_patience: 3.0

#The rate in Hz at which to run the global planning loop.
#If the frequency is set to 0.0, the global planner will only run
#when a new goal is received or the local planner reports that its path is blocked.
planner_frequency: 1.0

#How long the planner will wait in seconds in an attempt to find a valid plan before space-clearing operations are performed
planner_patience: 3.0

#Whether or not to enable the move_base recovery behaviors to attempt to clear out space.
recovery_behavior_enabled: true

#Determines whether or not the robot will attempt an in-place rotation when attempting to clear out space.
# Note: This parameter is only used when the default recovery behaviors are in use,
#meaning the user has not set the recovery_behaviors parameter to anything custom.
clearing_rotation_allowed: true

#Determines whether or not to shutdown the costmaps of the node when move_base is in an inactive stat
shutdown_costmaps: false

#How long in seconds to allow for oscillation before executing recovery behaviors.
#A value of 0.0 corresponds to an infinite timeout.
oscillation_timeout: 10.0
#How far in meters the robot must move to be considered not to be oscillating.
#Moving this far resets the timer counting up to the ~oscillation_timeout
